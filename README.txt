== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the format of the generated avatars?  =

You can select from .svg (Recommended), .png and .jpg.
To use .png and .jpg you will need GD image library installed in order to work.

= Which format should I use?  =

The recommended format(.svg) is the best option. This option generates the images with the best quality and the resource required to generate it is very low.
However there are some cases where you will need to user .png or .jpg, for example if you are sending avatar images in your emails.
There is a know issue that email clients like gmail uses a proxy to show the images and at this point does not support .svg format.

= How avatars are generated?  =

The plugin generates the avatar automatically using defined config.
Avatars are generated only once so your site performance wont get affected

= How avatars are stored?  =

Avatars are stored in your uploads folder.

= Will I be able to select my own letters? =

No. The plugin automatically generates the image with the initial letters of you First name and Last name.

= Can I use gravatar if the user has one? =

Yes. There is an option in plugins settings that allows you to show user gravatar if available instead of letter avatar.

= I see a black background in the avatars  =

Probably you are using .jpg format to generate a round avatar. This format does not support image transparency.
Use .png format instead.
